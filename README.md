# Clustering and Classification Using-Deep Learning on MINST Dataset
This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates the application of dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization techniques on the MNIST fashion dataset. The primary algorithms used are PCA (Principal Component Analysis), K-Means clustering, and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).
